### **Introduction to Geology**  
Geology is the study of the Earth, its materials, the processes acting upon them, and the history of the planet and its life forms since its origin. This field plays a crucial role in understanding natural resources, environmental changes, and hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides.

### 1. Earth's Layers and Composition 
The Earth is composed of several layers, each with distinct properties:  

#### A. Crust  
- The outermost layer of the Earth.  
- Made up of solid rock, primarily granite (continental crust) and basalt (oceanic crust).  
- Thickness: **5-70 km** (thin under oceans, thicker under continents).  
- It contains minerals and resources such as quartz, feldspar, and iron ores.  

#### **B. Mantle**  
- Located beneath the crust, it extends to about **2,900 km** deep.  
- Made up of semi-solid rock, primarily composed of silicate minerals like **olivine** and **pyroxene**.  
- Convection currents in the mantle drive **plate tectonics**.  

#### C. Outer Core  
- A liquid layer composed of **iron** and **nickel**.  
- Creates the Earth’s **magnetic field** through the movement of molten metals.  

#### D. Inner Core  
- The hottest part of the Earth, reaching temperatures of 5,000 - 6,000°C.  
- A solid ball of iron and nickel, despite the high temperature, due to immense pressure.

### 2. Plate Tectonics and Continental Drift 
The Earth's crust is divided into **tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid mantle. These plates move due to convection currents, leading to various geological activities.  

#### A. Major Plate Boundaries
1. Divergent Boundaries: Plates move apart, forming new crust. Example: Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  
2. Convergent Boundaries: Plates collide, causing subduction or mountain formation. Example: Himalayas.  
3. Transform Boundaries: Plates slide past each other, causing earthquakes. Example: San Andreas Fault.  

#### B. Continental Drift Theory 
- Proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912.  
- Suggested that continents were once joined together in a supercontinent called Pangaea.  
- Over millions of years, continents drifted to their present locations.  


### **3. Rock Cycle and Types of Rocks**  
Rocks are classified into three main types based on their formation:  

#### **A. Igneous Rocks**  
- Formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.  
- **Intrusive Igneous Rocks**: Formed inside the Earth (e.g., **granite**).  
- **Extrusive Igneous Rocks**: Formed on the surface from lava (e.g., **basalt**, **pumice**).  

#### **B. Sedimentary Rocks**  
- Formed from the compaction and cementation of sediments.  
- Often contain **fossils** and provide historical records of past life.  
- Examples: **Limestone**, **sandstone**, **shale**.  

#### **C. Metamorphic Rocks**  
- Formed when existing rocks are altered by heat, pressure, or chemical processes.  
- Examples: **Marble** (from limestone), **schist**, **gneiss**.

### **4. Minerals and Their Properties**  
Minerals are naturally occurring inorganic substances with a specific chemical composition.  

#### **A. Common Mineral Properties**  
1. **Hardness** – Measured on the **Mohs scale** (e.g., diamond = 10, talc = 1).  
2. **Luster** – How light reflects off the surface (e.g., metallic, glassy).  
3. **Cleavage & Fracture** – The way a mineral breaks (smooth vs. irregular).  
4. **Color & Streak** – The color of the mineral and its powdered form.  

#### **B. Important Minerals in Geology**  
- **Quartz** – Found in many rock types, used in glassmaking.  
- **Feldspar** – Most abundant mineral group, used in ceramics.  
- **Calcite** – Found in limestone, reacts with acid.  
- **Hematite & Magnetite** – Major iron ores.

### **5. Geological Time Scale and Fossils**  
The Earth's history is divided into major time units based on geological events and fossil records.  

#### **A. Eons, Eras, and Periods**  
- **Precambrian (4.6 billion – 541 million years ago)** – Earliest life forms.  
- **Paleozoic Era (541 – 252 million years ago)** – Marine life, first land plants.  
- **Mesozoic Era (252 – 66 million years ago)** – Age of dinosaurs.  
- **Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago – Present)** – Age of mammals, modern continents.  

#### **B. Fossils and Their Importance**  
- Fossils are preserved remains of ancient life.  
- Used to determine the **relative age** of rocks.  
- Help in studying **evolution** and past environments.

### **6. Natural Disasters and Geological Hazards**  

#### **A. Earthquakes**  
- Caused by the movement of tectonic plates.  
- Measured on the **Richter scale** or **Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw)**.  
- Seismic waves detected using **seismographs**.  

#### **B. Volcanoes**  
- Formed by magma rising to the surface.  
- Types:
  - **Shield Volcanoes** – Broad, slow eruptions (e.g., Hawaii).  
  - **Stratovolcanoes** – Explosive eruptions (e.g., Mount St. Helens).  
  - **Cinder Cone Volcanoes** – Small, steep cones.  

#### **C. Landslides**  
- Rapid movement of rock and soil due to gravity.  
- Triggered by earthquakes, heavy rain, or human activity.  

#### **D. Tsunamis**  
- Large sea waves caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.  
- Can travel at speeds over **800 km/h (500 mph)**.

### **7. Geological Resources and Human Impact**  

#### **A. Natural Resources**  
- **Fossil Fuels**: Coal, oil, and natural gas formed from ancient organic matter.  
- **Metallic Minerals**: Iron, copper, gold, and aluminum.  
- **Non-Metallic Minerals**: Sand, gravel, gypsum (for construction).  

#### **B. Environmental Impact**  
- Deforestation & Mining**: Leads to soil erosion and habitat loss.  
- Climate Change: Burning fossil fuels increases CO₂ levels.  
- Conservation Efforts: Sustainable mining and renewable energy.
